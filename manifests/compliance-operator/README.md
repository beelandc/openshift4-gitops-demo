# OpenShift Compliance Operator

## Usage

This is to deploy the [Compliance Operator](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/security/compliance_operator/compliance-operator-understanding.html) into an OpenShift 4.6 or later cluster. This operator
provides compliance scanning based on selectable set of rules.

In the overlays folder is a demo scan which will run a moderate level scan against OpenShift as well as the RHCOS nodes.
